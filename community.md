Most projects will have these documents at the top level of the repository:

***LICENSE:*** The project must contain an open-source license. If the project doesn't have a license, it's not open source.
README: The README file usually serves as the welcome page for the project. It generally provides information on how to get started using the project. It's also common for it to add information on how to engage with the community.
__CONTRIBUTING:__ As its name suggests, this document provides guidance on how to contribute to the project. It usually describes how the contribution process works, and includes details on how to set up your development environment.
CODE_OF_CONDUCT: The code of conduct sets ground rules for community members. By doing so, it helps make the community a safe and welcoming environment for all.
Although not all projects have CONTRIBUTING or CODE_OF_CONDUCT documents, having these documents is a good indication of how friendly and welcoming a project is.

Open-source contributors and maintainers come from all over the world. Projects usually have multiple communication channels to organize discussions and ask for help. A good way to familiarize yourself with the community is by reading through some of these communication channels:

Issue tracker: Where folks discuss issues and tasks related to the project. To find the issues in GitHub, you can go to the main page of the repository on GitHub and add /issues to the end of the URL, for example: https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues.
Pull request: Where folks discuss and review changes to the project. You can find it in GitHub by adding pulls to the project's URL, for example, https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pulls.
Chat channels and forums: Some projects use chat channels, such as Slack, Gitter, and IRC, or forums like Discourse for conversations and discussions.
