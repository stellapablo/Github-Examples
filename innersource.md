InnerSource 
```

Is the practice of applying open-source patterns to projects with a limited audience. For example, a company may establish an InnerSource program that mirrors the structure of a typical open-source project, except that it's only accessible to the employees of that company. In effect, it's an open-source program behind your company's firewall.

# Set repository visibility and permissions

You can configure GitHub repositories with three levels of visibility. Users who don't meet the visibility requirement see "not found" pages when they try to access your repository. The levels are:

1. Public repositories are visible to everyone. Use this visibility for projects that are truly open source and offer access to people inside and outside of your organization.
2. Internal repositories are only visible to members of the organization that owns them. Use this visibility for InnerSource projects.
3. Private repositories are only visible to the owner and any teams or individuals they add. Use this visibility for projects that only specific users and groups should have access to.

Once you've established repository visibility, you can configure permissions on an individual or team basis. There are five permission levels:

a. Read level is recommended for non-code contributors who want to view or discuss the project.
b. Triage level is recommended for contributors who need to proactively manage issues and pull requests without write access.
c. Write level is recommended for contributors who actively push to the project.
d. Maintain level is recommended for project managers who need to manage the repository without access to sensitive or destructive actions.
e. Admin level is recommended for people who need full access to the project, including sensitive and destructive actions like managing security or deleting a repository.
